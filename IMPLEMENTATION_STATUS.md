  - `PlaylistResolver.cs` - Enhanced playlist processing with error handling
  - `DashboardViewModel.cs` - UI workflow for playlist downloads
  - `DownloadMultipleSetupViewModel.cs` - Video selection and configuration dialog
- ✅ **Library Support**: YoutubeExplode library successfully processes the URL
- ✅ **Test Validation**: Comprehensive test suite confirms functionality works correctly
- ✅ **Documentation**: Full user documentation exists in `PLAYLIST_DOCUMENTATION.md`
